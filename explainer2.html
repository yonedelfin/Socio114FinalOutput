        As the rich prosper and the poor suffer, the affluent exploit the disadvantaged under the guise of "building a great society." Yet, these actions prove ineffective in achieving the intended goal. By applying Systems theory, the elected officials can be considered as the elements of capitalism’s exploitative system. Even if you constantly change the president every year, if the system does not consider exploitation as a problem, it will persist. This is also applicable for changing the relations between the elements in the system. For example, the government provides temporary solutions for environmental issues, like Quezon City’s sari-sari store refill hubs, without acknowledging the role of large corporations in environmental pollution, creating imbalanced relations in this scenario.

        In the third section, I examined how various social systems intersect with environmental issues, including democratization, colonization, globalization, capitalism, ageism, ableism, and gender. Within the democratization system, I argued that elected leaders' coercive power enables them to influence environmental decisions. An example of this is the Villar family’s influence, particularly Mark Villar’s role as the previous Secretary of Public Works and Highways during the Duterte administration. Given the family's focus on real estate and development, his position can impact project implementation. Moreover, the concept of desirability as discussed in ageism and ableism can be associated with how we have inherent biases of what is beautiful and desirable. Farms and mountains are replaced with luxury resorts like the New Clark City, suggesting a perception that agricultural landscapes lack importance and desirability for progress, thus, leading to a shift to something more "modern."

        To broaden the perspective beyond the local context, I connected the analysis to Wallerstein’s World Systems theory. This theory suggests that the current environmental state results from years of colonial exploitation, emphasizing the dynamics between core and peripheral countries. The former benefits from the degradation and underdevelopment of peripheral nations, exacerbating challenges for vulnerable communities like women, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. Women experience subordination due to societal norms, forced into a patriarchal structure where men control them. The elderly and persons with disabilities are treated as second-class citizens, facing additional challenges from societal biases.  As a contemplative question, I ponder how these social groups might be treated during times of total environmental crisis, considering their current difficulties and hardships.

        Lastly, I concluded the final output with reflections on hope. What would the future look like in a society that holds hope in the face of structural adversity? It’s so easy to be disheartened with all the chaos that happens in the world. However, once we understand how environmental issues are structural – instead of purely personal – and how we can use our agency for progress, we lay the groundwork for questioning the system and enabling its transformation.
