      For this final output, I made an interactive website similar to a video game. I chose this medium because I enjoy integrating sociological concepts into games and websites. The main theme I chose for the design of the website is Stardew Valley, a game about farming, which aligns with my chosen topic of environmental sociology. In the final output, I wanted to emphasize the connection of sociology with the environment and the structural barriers that affect related issues.

      The website is set in a future Philippines, portraying an environmental dystopia. As you click through the dialogue, the Keeper of Nature guides you through the nation's history and the systems involved. He gives you the Scepter of Hope, an item representing the power of hope in the face of adversity.  My main source of inspiration for this output is Lueck’s (2007) paper on hope as a bridge between structure and agency within the context of environmental change. I was motivated by the posts I was seeing online about how big corporations shift the blame onto regular individuals to save the environment (e.g., targeting consumers to buy metal straws). Another paper I drew inspiration from was Pellow and Brehm’s (2013) paper which explored the current state of environmental sociology. They emphasized how environmental issues were structural and how various social systems are involved in their persistence.

      To give more context about the scepter, it acts as a symbol of possibility and change. As a student studying sociology, I felt pessimistic about environmental issues because I felt powerless with how limited my personal resources are and how corporations continue to take advantage of the system that benefits them. In the imaginary world that I created, the scepter grants the user the ability of Perspective, which represents the real-life ability to view personal problems as public issues. These public issues are then influenced by systems that are interconnected with one another.

      To set the foundation for the dystopian setting of the dialogue, I based it from current Philippine society. Our colonial history birthed institutions molded for and by our colonizers, fostering a fragmented national identity. This is also evident in the condition of our national government, where our colonizers restricted voting rights to the affluent and privileged, allowing the local administration to be influenced and dominated by the privileged segments of society. As time progressed in our capitalist society, technological improvements necessitated extracting resources from the environment, resulting in environmental degradation. This is exemplified by how the elites keep building tourist spots and unnecessary infrastructures for the sake of so-called development that only benefits those with money. As mentioned in the dialogue, the function of capitalism is to accumulate as much wealth as it can to reinforce and sustain itself. However, as capitalism fulfills this function, it also leads to its own downfall by further increasing inequality among the population.
